# Ruby-Proxy-Scraper
A very simple script I wrote to grab proxies from a source list, uses Nokogiri to parse HTML.

Change inputFile and outputFile variables as desired.

Input format should be non SSL websites seperated by new lines.

Eg.
http://www.fakeurl.com

http://www.newurl.com

http://www.fakesite.com
